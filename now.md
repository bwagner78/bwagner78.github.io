# What I’m Doing Now

*Updated: 10-16-2025*


### Preaching & Teaching
I am currently preaching through the book of [Genesis](https://www.sermonaudio.com/series/202049). It has been nearly 10 years since I preached through this book, and I am really enjoying it. The biblical theology in this book continues to amaze me each week.

I am working through Psalm 119 for our evening worship and prayer meeting. 

### Reading
There are a few books or authors in constant rotation, the faithful voices that I love to return to. Currently, I am slowly reading through *[The Christian Ministry](https://banneroftruth.org/us/store/church-ministry/the-christian-ministry/)*, by Charles Bridges, and *[Sin and Temptation](https://www.crossway.org/books/sin-and-temptation-hccase/)*, by John Owen. 

The reading stack also includes:
- *Given for You: Reclaiming Calvin’s Doctrine of the Lord’s Supper*, Keith Mathison
- *On Reading Well*, Karen Swallow Prior

On my nightstand:
- The Complete Grimms' Fairy Tales
- The Poetry of Robert Frost

### Family
The now “Wagner 8” is doing great. JW was married this summer, and it was nothing less than magical. KW is engaged to a wonderful young man, and we are in wedding planning mode. NW is now a licensed driver. FW is devouring books and dancing through life.

Annie and I continued to be amazed by all of God’s kindness to us. We are absolutely loving this season of life.

Hat tip to Derek Sivers for the idea of a [“Now” page](https://nownownow.com/about). I’m not on social media, so this serves as a small way to stay connected through occasional updates, like I would when catching up with an old friend.
