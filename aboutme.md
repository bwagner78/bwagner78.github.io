**Howdy, and welcome to my weblog.**

Just what exactly have you stumbled upon here? Well, it is the place where I sporadically publish updates from ordinary life. Let me explain. 

Back in the 2000s, before corporations hijacked blogging to appear personal and side hustlers tried to make money on clicks, a blog was just people writing for other people to read. There wasn’t this salivating for likes, for clicks, for sharing, or SEO. Just writing. 

I am here for the writing—for the posts about family, [my church](https://www.ibcsac.org), what I’m reading, random observations, or even the obscure memoir.

Honestly, I have been a bit hesitant to write and post with any frequency. I have been hamstrung by the thought that someone else has probably already said it better than I would. So, why should I bother banging out a few more keystrokes on the matter?

Well, I have [this to blame](https://www.challies.com/articles/why-you-shouldnt-stop-blogging-or-why-you-should-consider-starting/). And also [this](https://www.thatcontentshed.com/blog/whats-the-point).

### So, what you have here is a collection of “dispatches from ordinary life.” 

* This is a peek into how this middle-aged guy is working out being a Protestant Christian, married to his wonderful wife for over 20 years, raising 4 kids, and working a job. 

* I am an unashamed devotee to the local church. She is the means God has chosen to change the world. Get on board.

* I am convinced we are the happiest when we are content with our relative obscurity and shrug our shoulders at the alluring 15 minutes of fame. It’s when we stop clamoring to become “world-changers” and swap out our selfish ambition for godliness with contentment. Or, to put it this way: *“to live a quiet life, to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands”* (1 Thessalonians 4:11). Christian discipleship is the most subversive reformation imaginable.

* Occasionally, I have been known to throw out a podcast now and then with [my wife](https://twitter.com/awags3) called [*Ordinary Reformation*](https://www.ordinaryreformation.com). This is just another expression of what I have become convinced of: theology matters. The doctrines of the Protestant Reformation are ***life-changing***, but not only for the seminary or bookish recluse—they have their most significant change within the every-day details of our ordinary lives.

So there ya have it.
