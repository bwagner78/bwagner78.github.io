I recently listened to a lecture on the virtue of making lists. There is neurotic list-making as a form of control, but there can also be virtue in our list-making as an expression of attention and even love. For the past 5-6 years, I have made a habit of writing down what I have read each year. It is a small way to give attention to what I am thinking about and I enjoy going back through these lists years later and perusing through what captured my attention.

Of note, on this year’s list, I decided to finally read through the Harry Potter series. I am through book 4 and thoroughly enjoying them!
