Issue number eight of *[Mere Orthodoxy](https://mereorthodoxy.com/journal)* arrived in the mail this week and I was greeted with some wisdom from T.S. Elliot.

> I confess, however, that I am not myself very much concerned with the question of influence, or with those publicists who have impressed their names upon the public by catching the morning tide and rowing very fast in the direction in which the current was flowing; but rather that there should always be a few writers preoccupied in penetrating to the core of the matter, in trying to arrive at the truth and to set it forth, without too much hope, without ambition to alter the immediate course of affairs, and without being downcast or defeated when nothing appears to ensue.

If you replace “publicists” with “pastors,” the wisdom remains equally as true.
