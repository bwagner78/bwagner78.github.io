Chances are, if you have rummaged around the pile of build-your-own-website options, you have come across the wonderful world of website builders. These are the game-changers that allow the code-ignorant to publish their own website with a paint-by-numbers sort of approach. It sounds so easy, right?

- Import a pre-built template
- Drag and drop a few content blocks
- Hit publish

Providers like Wix, Squarespace, WordPress.com, and Weebly have become the quick onramp to setting up a website with minimal technical knowledge. Unfortunately, it’s too good to be true. Anyone can throw a template together and call it a website. But what about the actual words? Where is the story, the brand, and the dots that connect together to form the big picture? Void of solid copywriting and content development you run the risk of publishing an enormous waste of time. As my grandpa would say, “All hat and no cattle.”

## All Template and No Content
Your website looks great, but does it have the necessary content to flag down search engines, engage potential clients, and keep them coming back? Chances are, if you are reading this, you are a small business owner, perhaps a sole proprietor who has stumbled upon this site in a burnt-out effort to magically get content on your website (thanks, Google!). All is not lost, help is out there. In fact, you already have one of the most important ingredients in baking up an online presence you can be proud of. After all, no one knows your business better than you. You have the expertise, the angle, the history, and the reputation; now you just need someone to help organize, polish, and communicate what you already do.

## Content Development For The Win
This is why content development will beat out pixels any day. Words, phrases, headers, and body all working together to become searchable, clear content that you can be proud of. This is something that a website builder alone will never be able to serve up.

Don’t settle for “published” without the polish of good writing and actionable content.
